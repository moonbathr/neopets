# Neopets
Scripts for Neopets.

* **bookmark_boards.js** (TM/GM script) - adds a module to the top of the main neoboards page with some popular boards
* **follow_users.js** (TM/GM script) - adds a "follow/unfollow" button to users posts; when "follow" is toggled the user's board titles are bolded unless the user is unfollowed - this will *only* work with the altador theme or other custom CSS that removes the bolded board titles in the native beta themes
* **altador_theme.css** (site theme) - new site theme with several minor aesthetic improvements; hides social media icons

## using new theme
1. download Stylebot extension
2. Stylebot > options > new style
3. enter URL: `www.neopets.com`
4. copy & paste CSS into the body - do not add style tags
